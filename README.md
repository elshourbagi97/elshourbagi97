## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a 27-year-old developer who transitioned from engineering to tech — and I haven’t looked back since.

💡 I specialize in building modern, responsive full-stack web applications.  
🎨 I care deeply about UI/UX, accessibility, and writing clean, scalable code.  
🚀 Currently exploring **Webflow**, and improving my skills in **React**, **Laravel**, and **UI design**.

⚽ Outside of coding, I enjoy football, photography, and playing Valorant. 🎮
